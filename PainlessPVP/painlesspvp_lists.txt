
Some fixes and features for pvp !



STACK
--------------------------------------------------------

? some way to remember the regions or interpolation to catch some edge cases (should probably add an option to only check x-z dist)?

? move invisibility fixes to this plugin ?

? should member perm also let owners keep inventory ?

! More flexible content policy => allow adding items if some are there already - count free slots - which to drop on conflicts ...

! add configurability !

! find bugs
